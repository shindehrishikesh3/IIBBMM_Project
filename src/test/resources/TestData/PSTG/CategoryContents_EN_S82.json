They are also used in industrial power supplies. Aluminium electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors because of their anodization principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity.<br><br>Typical applications of aluminium electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are:<br>Input and output decoupling capacitors for smoothing and filtering.<br>DC-link capacitors in AC/AC converters for variable-frequency drive and frequency changers<br>Correction capacitors for power factor correction<br>What are the advantages of aluminium electrolytic capacitors?<br>Electrolytic aluminium capacitors provide a much higher level of capacitance for a given volume than most ceramic capacitors. This means that high value electrolytic capacitors can be relatively small. This is a significant advantage in many instances.<br><br>Electrolytic capacitors are now being used increasingly in designs that are manufactured using surface mount technology, SMT. Originally they were not used in particularly high quantities because they were not able to withstand some of the soldering processes. Now improved capacitor design along with the use of reflow techniques instead of wave soldering enables electrolytic capacitors to be used more widely in surface mount format.<br><br>How is an aluminium electrolytic capacitor different from a polymer?<br>The most notable difference between aluminum electrolytics and polymers is their electrolyte. Aluminium electrolytics have a liquid electrolyte while polymers have a solid electrolyte. These differences play a major role in the characteristics of each type of capacitor.<br><br>Polymers are higher cost, and have higher leakage currents and lower surge voltages. However they offer lower ESR at high frequencies, higher ripple current ratings, temperature stability, and a long life. There are other advantages and disadvantages to both types.",

The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminium or zinc applied directly to the surface of the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on a printed circuit board, or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body.<br><br>Polyester film capacitors are film capacitors using a dielectric made of the thermoplastic polar polymer material polyethylene terephthalate (PET), trade names Hostaphan or Mylar, from the polyester family.

Plastic film/metalized film capacitors come in a wide range of capacitance values. Ceramic capacitors, on the other hand, are only suitable for circuits requiring low capacitance.<br><br>Film capacitors are chosen over ceramic capacitors for specific applications such as analogue signal processing and audio circuits due to their low distortion factor.

They are available in small values, and are mostly used at high frequencies and in cases where low losses (high Q) and low capacitor change over time is desired.<br><br>What are mica capacitors used for?<br>Silver mica capacitors are indispensable in some custom applications. Circuit designers turn to mica capacitors for high-power applications such as RF transmitters and electric instruments and amplifiers because cheaper ceramic and porcelain capacitors cannot withstand heat as well. Silver mica remains widely used in high-voltage applications, due to mica’s high breakdown voltage.<br><br>They are also found in power RF circuits where stability is of utmost importance.

This is because the inherent self-resonant frequency (SRF), which is the point where the capacitor will exhibit the least amount of impedance, of an SLC is the highest of any discrete lumped constant capacitor. Capacitors with a high SRF have low equivalent series resistance (ESR), which is the internal resistance in the capacitor that appears in series with the capacitance of the device.<br><br>This is important because, in general, ESR increases as frequency increases, so using a capacitor that has inherently low ESR is necessary. Additionally, since SLCs are formed monolithically, the number of mechanical parts in the SLC is limited, which also contributes to a lower ESR value.<br><br>One potential drawback of SLCs is that since they comprise just a single layer of material, capacitance is heavily dependent on the dielectric constant of the dielectric used, which limits the capacitance that can be achieved.
