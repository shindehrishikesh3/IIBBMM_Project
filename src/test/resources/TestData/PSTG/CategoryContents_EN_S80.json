If the current varies over time, then so will the flux - and a current will flow in a second conductor if it is permeated by such a time varying magnetic field. This effect is known as inductance.<br><br>Coupled inductors comprise two coils of wire wrapped around a magnetic core.

The voltage across the second coil depends on the rate of change of current in the first, and the mutual inductance of the system.<br><br>Applications for coupled inductors<br><br>Purpose-designed coupled inductors are used in a variety of power conversion circuits such as flyback, SEPIC, Fly-Buck™, Cuk, ZETA and multi-phase topologies. These voltage regulation circuits use coupled inductors to efficiently provide the required output voltages, which may be stepped up or down from the input. To do this, SEPIC and Zeta circuits use 1:1 coupled inductors, whereas flyback and other circuits use 1:N inductors. In multi-phase power converters, coupled inductors provide inherent ripple current cancelling that is not provided by single inductors.<br><br>You can connect coupled inductor windings in different configurations to serve different purposes.

Automotive applications provide a good representation of how they are being used: specific automotive examples include Ethernet, tyre pressure monitoring systems (TPMS), remote keyless entry (RKE), Bluetooth/W-LAN, FM/DAB tuner, navigation devices, camera, telematics, LIDAR and mmWave radar, dedicated short range communications (DSCR), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.<br><br>When choosing high frequency inverters, it is important to be aware of their self-resonant frequency (SRF). Up to this frequency, the device will exhibit an inductive characteristic, where impedance increases with frequency. Impedance reaches its maximum at the self-resonant frequency, which is therefore the best point for choke (signal blocking) applications. Beyond this frequency the inductor exhibits a capacitive characteristic in which impedance decreases with frequency.<br><br>With this in mind, high frequency inductor selection involves several key parameters: mounting (surface mount or through-hole), inductance value, current rating, DC resistance (DCR), self-resonant frequency, Q factor, and temperature rating. While small size is typically desired, the laws of physics limit how small an inductor can be for a given application. Inductance value and current rating are the chief determinants of size; other parameters can then be optimized.",

Instead, it comprises windings coiled onto an insulator such as Bakelite, glass, or PTFE, with only air inside the coil.<br><br>One of the biggest advantages of an air core inductor is the minimal signal loss that occurs at higher magnetic field strengths. With ferromagnetic cores such as iron, the core can become magnetically saturated when the magnetic field is too strong.

			"CONTENT": "Our range of Common Mode Chokes includes both radial leaded and SMD types.<br>A common mode choke is an electrical filter that blocks high frequency noise common to two or more data or power lines while allowing the desired DC or low-frequency signal to pass. Common mode (CM) noise current is typically radiated from sources such as unwanted radio signals, unshielded electronics, inverters and motors. Left unfiltered, this noise presents interference problems in electronics and electrical circuits.<br>How do common mode chokes work?<br>In normal or differential (single choke) mode, current travels on one line in one direction from the source to the load, and in the opposite direction on the return line that completes the circuit. In common mode, the noise current travels on both lines in the same direction.<br>This means that the combined magnetic flux adds to create an opposing field to block the noise. In differential mode, the current travels in opposite directions and the flux subtracts or cancels out so that the field does not oppose the normal mode signal.<br>How to choose a Common Mode Choke?<br>The main criteria for selecting a common mode choke are:<br>Required impedance: How much attenuation of noise is needed?<br>Required frequency range: Over what frequency bandwidth is the noise?<br>Required current handling: How much differential mode current must it handle?<br>Types of common mode chokes<br>High-Speed and Super-Speed Data Line EMI Chokes<br>Data Line Common Mode EMI Chokes<br>Data/Power Line Common Mode EMI Chokes<br>Surface Mount Power Line Common Mode EMI Chokes<br>Through-Hole Power Line Common Mode EMI Chokes<br>Applications for common mode chokes<br>Common mode choke coils are suited for noise suppression on lines with large current flows, such as AC/DC power supply lines. The distortion of the waveform is reduced. Common mode choke coils are suited for noise suppression on lines where signal waveform distortion causes a problem, such as video signal lines.<br>Common mode choke application example<br>As the auto industry’s boom continues, the adoption of electronic devices in automobiles has grown rapidly. Thanks to this trend, vehicles can now be equipped with a variety of features, such as infotainment systems, ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems), navigation systems, OBD (on-board diagnostics), and others.<br>CAN bus (Controlled Area Network) is one of the communication standards that allows all these features to function in unison. It uses two-wire differential signalling to send and receive data from the different devices in the network. While the nodes of the bus can be near other EMI sources in the vehicle, the design of a robust CAN bus that can withstand all incoming noise is integral to delivering a reliable and safe vehicle. In addition to other filtering techniques, common mode chokes are one of the devices that are used to combat noise in a CAN bus.",

			"CONTENT": "We offer EMI Noise Filters with 275V or 475V input voltage.<br>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is simply noise interference caused by external electromagnetic waves. EMI can lead to the performance degradation of any electrical equipment design within range by inducing unwanted currents and voltages in its circuitry.<br>These effects can be mitigated with an EMI filter - an electronic component that provides electromagnetic noise suppression for electronic devices. This filter is typically used together with shields and other types of protection. EMI filters only extract and remove offending noise components that can cause electromagnetic noise from electric currents that conduct through electrical wiring.<br>Apart from using them to protect their electronic devices, designers need EMI noise filters to meet regulatory agency requirements for RF/wireless devices for use in the USA (FCC), Canada (IC), Europe (CE), and many other countries. These dictate that radiated and conducted emissions be constrained below specified limits and must pass immunity/transient requirements. Designers need to understand that EMI noise filters will help in meeting immunity and fast transient requirements as well as radiated emissions to achieve a robust design.<br>Our EMI noise filter manufacturers’ offerings include the following types:<br>Sensata/Crydom’s 1F25 EMI noise filter is for use with SSRs in single-phase systems. The AC filter connects between incoming lines of the main supply, reduces conducted noise by around 30dB and is easily added to existing designs.<br>The 3F20 is similar to the 1F25, but for SSRs in three-phase systems.<br>Murata’s block type \"EMIFIL\" BNX series incorporates a through-type capacitor, monolithic chip capacitors and bead. The high performance BNX is for use in DC power circuits.<br>The filter provides a high insertion loss in a wide frequency range from 0.5MHz to 1GHz. It is effective against impulse noise such as electrostatic discharge or spikes.",

Ferrites are hard, brittle, iron-containing, and generally grey or black and are polycrystalline—i.e., made up of a large number of small crystals. They are composed of iron oxide and one or more other metals in chemical combination. They offer high magnetic permeability and high electrical resistance.<br>Ferrites are commonly used in the electronic industry. They are found in transformers, inductors, personal computers, televisions, power supplies, electromagnets, and more. Their high electrical resistance leads to low eddy current losses.<br>High permeability to magnetic fields is particularly desirable in devices such as antennas. Also, by using ferrites in electrical products, manufacturers improve their ability to prevent high-frequency electrical noise. Ferrites act as EMI/RFI filters to suppress noise (Radio Frequency Interference) from entering or exiting the product. Thus, it eventually helps in improving the performance of the product and enhancing the customer experience.<br>A ferrite cylindrical core is the most commonly used ferrite core for cable noise or EMI suppression. A cylindrical ferrite core can be easily slipped around a cable for power decoupling and filtering. With the material and shape selection, the characteristics of a ferrite core can be completely altered.<br>A ferrite bead is made with ferrite material in a hollow cylinder shape to provide a simple, economical technique to attenuate or suppress high-frequency noise within electronic circuits. Alternate names are ferrite block, ferrite ring, ferrite choke, or EMI filter.<br>Ferrite material is used in tiles, plates, or pads in wireless power charging systems to increase system efficiency, by shielding and reflecting the magnetic field within the inductive transfer area.<br>A flat cable core ferrite snaps on to a cable such as a ribbon cable, or internal and external computer data and power cables, to provide electromagnetic compatibility.<br>A split core ferrite or sleeve ferrite clamp installs onto wired cables, and cables with connectors.",
