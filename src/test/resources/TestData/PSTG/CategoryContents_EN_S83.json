			"CONTENT": "Our selection of linear potentiometers ranges from 1kΩ to 10kΩ, and 200mW to 400mW.<br><br>What is the difference between a linear and rotary potentiometer<br>A potentiometer consists of a three-terminal resistor and a moving contact, all of which form an adjustable voltage divider. Their name comes from the fact that they serve as a voltage divider that varies electrical potential.<br>They can be classified as rotary or linear potentiometers:<br>Rotational potentiometers<br><br>A rotational potentiometer offers control using a spinning knob that adjusts the point of contact between the wiper and a nearly-circular resistor. The rotation is typically – but not always - limited to one revolution, and the resistor is an almost-complete circle with a small notch removed.<br>Pros and Cons of Rotational Potentiometers<br><br>Pro: Space-saving. These pots rotate in place, which may make them better suited to small applications or devices.<br>Pro: Easy to seal. These pots seal well for two reasons: the knob naturally forms a sort of cap and the only point of entry for contamination is the small space between the knob and the housing in which it turns<br>Con: Hard to read. These devices offer little visual indication as to their positioning, making it difficult to read or compare them. Rotational pots may have a small indicator mark, but that may not be very intuitive for comparing or reading absolute levels.<br>Linear or Slide potentiometers<br><br>You can find slide potentiometers commonly on lighting and soundboards. These devices feature a small handle that can slide either horizontally or vertically – depending on installation – to control the point of contact between the wiper and the resistor.<br>Pros and Cons of Linear Potentiometers<br><br>Pro: Intuitive visual feedback. By putting an array of slide pots next to each other, it’s easy to compare the levels visually. This quality is why you’ll typically see linear pots in soundboards and graphic equalizers. The visual appearance of the array of sliders translates easily into a working idea of the tonal effect created.<br>Con: Vulnerability. These pots feature an open slot that runs the entire length of the slider, making them relatively easy to contaminate, harder to keep clean, and often shorter-lived as a result.<br>Where are linear potentiometers used?<br><br>The variety of applications for linear potentiometers is very large. They are used for length measurement in many laboratories as well as in industrial applications. The sensors are easy to install and offer precise measurement values even under difficult conditions. Linear potentiometers are well suited for use in precision engineering as well as more everyday products.<br>Application examples include:<br>Test/ lab applications<br>Mobile vehicle<br>Medical<br>Agricultural machinery<br>Industrial processing<br>Robotics<br>Industrial machinery<br>Motorsport<br>Audio and graphics",

			"CONTENT": "We offer a wide range of single-turn and multi-turn potentiometers with carbon, conductive plastic or wire wound resistance tracks.<br><br>What happens when you rotate a potentiometer knob?<br>Rotary potentiometers are three-terminal resistance devices. The outer two terminals are connected to each end of a resistance path – which could be carbon, conductive plastic, or wire-wound – whose resistance value gives the rating of the device. The middle terminal is connected to a wiper which is also mechanically connected to the control knob. As the control knob is rotated, the wiper moves along the resistance track.<br>If the external circuit is connected across the wiper and one end contact, the potentiometer acts as a rheostat or variable resistor. The series resistance in the external circuit varies as the potentiometer knob is rotated. Alternatively, if all three terminals are used, the potentiometer acts as a potential divider. For example, if the resistance track is connected between supply and ground, the voltage on the wiper varies as the potentiometer knob is turned. This voltage could be fed to the base of a transistor to control the sound level of an audio amplifier.<br>Note that a single-turn rotary potentiometer typically has less than 300 degrees of angular movement. Multi-turn potentiometers allow for a shaft rotation of more than 360 degrees of mechanical travel from one end of the resistive track to the other. Multi-turn pots are more expensive, but very stable with high precision used mainly for trimming and precision adjustments. The two most common multi-turn rotary potentiometers are the 3-turn (1080°) and 10-turn (3600°) types, but 5-turn, 20-turn and higher 25-turn pots are available in a variety of ohmic values.",

Ratings range from 1Ω to 250kΩ.<br><br>How does a slide potentiometer work?<br>Linear or slide potentiometers produce a resistance output that varies according to the displacement or position of a slider or wiper. They are variable resistors with three leads. Two leads connect to the ends of the resistor, so the resistance between them is fixed. The third lead connects to a slider that travels along the resistor varying the resistance between it and the other two connections. The resistance element is excited by either DC or AC voltage.<br>Note that \"Linear\" can also refer to the taper (law) defining how the output voltage varies with the motion of the slider. A linear taper means that resistance increases in direct proportion to the distance travelled along the resistive element. This contrasts with a change in resistance via a logarithmic scale (a log or audio taper).<br>Resistive element types can be carbon (inexpensive), cermet (relatively limited life), conductive plastic (long life), or wire wound (current drawn during use).",

The market leading brands AVX, KEMET and Vishay are included in our offering.<br><br>What is a tantalum capacitor?<br>A tantalum electrolytic capacitor is a type of electrolytic capacitor. It comprises a pellet of porous tantalum metal as an anode, covered by an insulating oxide layer that forms the dielectric, surrounded by liquid or solid electrolyte as a cathode. Because of its very thin and relatively high permittivity dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high capacitance per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.<br>Tantalum capacitors are inherently polarized components. Reverse voltage can destroy the capacitor. Non-polar or bipolar tantalum capacitors are made by effectively connecting two polarized capacitors in series, with the anodes oriented in opposite directions.<br>What are the benefits of a tantalum capacitor?<br>Applications using tantalum capacitors take advantage of their low leakage current, high capacity and long term stability and reliability. For example, they are used in sample and hold circuits which rely on low leakage current to achieve long hold duration. They are also commonly used for power supply filtering on computer motherboards and cell phones due to their small size and long term stability, most often in surface mount form.<br>Tantalum capacitors are also available in military specifications versions (MIL-SPEC), which offer tighter tolerances and a wider operating temperature range. They are a popular replacement for aluminium electrolytics in military applications because they do not tend to dry out and change capacitance over time. Medical electronics also rely on tantalum because of their high stability. Audio amplifiers sometimes use tantalum capacitors where stability is a critical factor.",

You can use 0Ω resistors as jumpers to disable a sub-section of a circuit. There are three kinds of Chip SMD Resistors:<br>Thin Film or Metal Film resistors are used in high precision applications like audio, medical, or test equipment.

These shunt resistors of known resistor value (R) are placed in a current conducting path so that the entire current (I) which is to be measured flows through them. By measuring the voltage drop (V) across the resistor and then using simple Ohm’s Law (I=V/R), we can calculate the amount of current that flows through the circuit.<br>Why use a current sense resistor?<br>Sensing the current flow is an important requirement in many power and general electronics applications. Often, current sensing is essential to monitor and control an application; for example, a battery charger circuit requires current sensing capability to correctly charge the battery and to determine the charge current needed from the driver.<br>How do I choose a current sense resistor?<br>The first step in selecting a current sense resistor is based on understanding the application, particularly in terms of its maximum input voltage. Also, as it will be passing a heavy current (because it is connected in series with the load) its I2R losses will likely be significant even if its resistance value is small. Therefore, a knowledge of its power rating is essential.<br>The next step is to know the tolerance and package required for the shunt resistor. Less than 1% tolerance is a good choice. But if the application demands extra accuracy, 0.5% to 0.1% tolerance shunt resistors may be more appropriate.<br>After choosing the value, power rating, and tolerance, it is important to select a suitable package that is easy to solder as well as with a lower footprint for smaller PCB areas.

Thick film networks have no better tolerance and drift specifications than conventional resistors, and so they cannot be used in demanding applications.

These networks combine from three to over twenty resistors in a single IC-like package. They increase design and layout options and can enhance performance when making the transition from the schematic circuit diagram to actual layout and bill of materials (BOM). Arrays are simply a subset of networks, in which all elements have the same ohmic value.<br>The network is especially beneficial when the design needs multiple pull-up, line-termination, or gain-setting resistors. Among the strongest cases for using such a network is the inherent matching it offers with respect to changes in resistance due to temperature shifts, a consequence of the common thermal substrate. This is an important consideration in many sensor- and interface-related applications where balanced or ratiometric circuits facilitate cancellation of drift-related errors. It’s important to remember that, whilst discrete resistors can provide close TCR matching, through selection or tight absolute TCR, they can never offer matching of actual element temperatures.",
