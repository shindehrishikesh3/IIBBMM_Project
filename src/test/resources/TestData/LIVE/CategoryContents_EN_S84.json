			"CONTENT": "We offer Carbon Film, Metal Film, Thin Film, and Thick Film MELF SMD resistors, in resistance values from 0.1Ω to 10MΩ.<br><br>What are the advantages of MELF resistors?<br>MELF SMD resistors are the perfect choice for applications where reliability and stability are of major concern at higher power ratings and higher operating voltages.<br>Many electronic circuits are exposed to high pulse loads. This means that pulse-proof resistors are essential for protecting the circuit’s electronic components. These must be excellent in both pulse handling and long term stability, with low drift.<br>MELF SMD resistors offer a good solution. Although they are a thin film type, they are cylindrical rather than flat. This gives them a surface three times larger than a thin film resistor of the same size. This design also allows a helical trimming pattern to be used, enabling a uniform current distribution. Therefore, they can distribute heat more efficiently so their pulse load capability is five times higher, and their long term stability is excellent as well.<br>Apart from the standard metal film technology, MELF resistors are also available with carbon film, which has unrivalled thermal stability; this further enhances their pulse load capability.<br>MELF resistor package sizes<br>Farnell offers MELF resistors in package sizes from 0102 (2211 Metric) to 2512 (6432 Metric). We also offer 3614 Metric products.",
