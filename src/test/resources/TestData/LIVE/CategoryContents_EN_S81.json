Recently, a new type of RF package has emerged, one that is based on laminating multiple layers of organic materials together. This approach (multi-layer organic or MLO), combining thin organic dielectric materials embedded into substrates, has been applied to a variety of RF products, including tightly integrated RF front-end-modules and filters. It has proven to be more effective than other alternatives, such as low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) and conventional laminate substrates, which have difficulty integrating into shrinking sizes and silicon geometries.<br><br>Further, LTCC is a costly process that has had temperature-related failures with common PCB-type substrate materials, and the components based on LTCC suffer from performance drift with temperature changes. MLO filters offer a superior solution with performance that is consistent across the specified temperature ranges.<br><br>In addition to temperature, MLO devices provide significant electrical, physical and reliability advantages over traditional discrete RF or LTCC solutions.<br><br>Passive filter types<br>Low-pass filters attenuate or suppress signals with frequencies above a particular frequency called the cutoff or critical frequency. For example, a low-pass filter (LPF) with a cutoff frequency of 40 Hz can eliminate noise with a frequency of 60 Hz.<br>High-pass filters suppress or attenuate signals with frequencies lower than a particular frequency, also called the cutoff or critical frequency. For example, a high-pass filter (HPF) with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz can be used to suppress the unwanted DC voltage in amplifier systems, if desired.<br>Band-pass filters attenuate or suppress signals with frequencies outside a band of frequencies. They are common in TV or radio tuning circuits.<br>Band-reject, or notch filters attenuate or suppress signals with a range of frequencies. For instance, a notch filter can reject signals with frequencies between 50 Hz and 150 Hz.",

This enables it to be simply designed with minimal theoretical knowledge about the mathematics, unlike many other filters. However, its performance does not quite match that of other filter types, although for many applications it is more than adequate.<br><br>Butterworth: This type of filter provides the maximum in band flatness, although it provides a lower stop-band attenuation than a Chebyshev filter. However, it is also able to provide better group delay performance, and hence lower overshoot.<br><br>Bessel: This filter provides the optimum in-band phase response and therefore also provides the best step response. It is often used where signals incorporate square waves, etc as the shape is maintained best of all.<br><br>Chebyshev: This filter provides fast roll off after the cut off frequency is reached. However, this is at the expense of in-band ripple. The more in-band ripple that can be tolerated, the faster the roll off.<br><br>Elliptic: This filter, also known as the Cauer filter, has significant levels of in-band and out of band ripple, and as expected the higher the degree of ripple that can be tolerated, the steeper it reaches its ultimate roll off.",

SAW filters operate by converting electrical energy into acoustic or mechanical energy on a piezoelectric material. To do so these filters uses interdigital transducers (IDTs). The IDTs have interleaved metal electrodes on either end of the device which converts an electrical signal into an acoustic wave and then back to an electrical signal.<br><br>Once the electrical energy is converted into acoustic waves, the waves travel across the surface of an elastic, piezoelectric material with an amplitude decaying into the substrate material, such as quartz, lithium tantalite (LiTaO3) or lithium niobate (LiNbO3). This decay is what causes the insertion loss in SAW Filters.<br><br>What are SAW filters used for?<br>SAW filters are used to filter out desired frequencies. For example, they are widely used in mobile phones to filter both RF and IF frequencies,<br><br>SAW filters play an important role in suppressing high-order harmonics, image information, emission of leaked signals, and various parasitic clutter interference of electronic information equipment, and can achieve filtering of amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics with any required precision. This is difficult to accomplish with other filters.<br><br>What are the different types of SAW filters?<br>There are many different types of SAW filters. Examples include IF SAW filters, CDMA SAW filters, wideband SAW filters, and piezoelectric SAW filters. An IF SAW filter uses an intermediate frequency (IF) and suitable for many third-generation (3G) base station equipment protocols. A CDMA SAW filter is based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology.<br><br>CDMA SAW filters are used in mobile phones which operate in the frequency band of 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz.

Consequently, the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.<br><br>What is a diplexer used for?<br>A diplexer allows two different devices to share a common communications channel. Typically, the channel is a long coaxial cable, and a diplexer is often used at both ends of the coaxial cable. The plan is feasible if the two devices operate on different frequencies. The plan is economical if the diplexers cost less than running a second cable.<br><br>Diplexers are typically used with radio receivers or transmitters on different, widely separated, frequency bands. A single city radio tower might have a police department antenna on 460 MHz and a fire department antenna on 156 MHz.
