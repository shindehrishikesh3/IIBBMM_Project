It is used for its properties of high magnetic permeability coupled with low electrical conductivity (which helps prevent eddy currents). Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of RF transformers and inductors in applications such as switched-mode power supplies, and ferrite loop stick antennas for AM radio receivers.<br>There are two broad applications for ferrite cores which differ in size and frequency of operation: signal transformers, which are of small size and higher frequencies, and power transformers, which are of large size and lower frequencies. Cores can also be classified by shape, such as toroidal cores, shell cores or cylindrical cores.",

			"CONTENT": "We offer Radial Leaded Common Mode Chokes and Filters with inductance values from 350nH to 208mH, and DC current ratings from 100mA to 75A.<br>What is a Common Mode Choke?<br>A common mode choke is an electrical filter that blocks high frequency noise common to two or more data or power lines while allowing the desired DC or low-frequency signal to pass. Common mode (CM) noise current is typically radiated from sources such as unwanted radio signals, unshielded electronics, inverters, and motors. Left unfiltered, this noise presents interference problems in electronics and electrical circuits.<br>How do Common Mode Chokes Work?<br>In normal or differential mode (single choke), current travels on one line in one direction from the source to the load, and in the opposite direction on the return line that completes the circuit. In common mode, the noise current travels on both lines in the same direction.<br>In common mode, the current in a group of lines travels in the same direction so the combined magnetic flux adds to create an opposing field to block the noise. In differential mode, the current travels in opposite directions and the flux subtracts or cancels out so that the field does not oppose the normal mode signal.<br>How do I choose a Common Mode Choke?<br>The main criteria for selecting a common mode choke are:<br>Required impedance: How much attenuation of noise is needed?<br>Required frequency range: Over what frequency bandwidth is the noise?<br>Required current handling: How much differential mode current must it handle?<br>Radial leaded components<br>Radials differ from axials in that the leads exit from a common side of the component, rather from opposite ends or sides. This gives the radial a vertical profile and a smaller printed wiring footprint.",

Most modern, commonly used through-hole resistors have a wirewound or film construction. A wirewound resistor has a length of resistive wire that is wound around a supporting element from one end to the other. Most film resistors are composed of a carbon, metal, or metal-oxide film. In these resistors, a thin film of conductive material is deposited onto the ceramic element and a helix is cut from one end of the element to the other. It is then covered by an insulating material.<br>Through hole resistor size<br>As opposed to SMD resistors , through-hole (THT) resistors are not standardised, and manufacturers may use slightly different measurements. THT resistors are also sized based on their power ratings and their type, e.g. carbon material, wire-wound, carbon film, and metal film. For example, the width of a common 1/2W resistor is 9.2mm, while the length of a smaller 1/4W resistor is 6.3mm.

			"CONTENT": "We offer zero ohm resistors manufactured with ceramic, carbon film, metal, thick and thin film technologies, with current ratings from 500mA to 200A.<br>What is a zero ohm resistor?<br>A zero ohm resistor is a single resistor that is manufactured to have zero ohms of resistance when measured. A through-hole resistor with zero ohms is often marked with a single black band, which indicates the value of the resistance.<br>Meanwhile, a surface mount ceramic resistor will have a single or a multiple number of zeros to represent this zero ohm resistance. You can also imagine zero ohm resistors as jumper wires that are shaped as typical resistors. Measuring a zero ohm resistor with a multimeter will return in a reading that approaches zero ohm.<br>You may wonder why zero ohm resistors are necessary, when a jumper wire could do the same job. Certainly, if you’re building a PCB with manual placement and soldering, using a jumper wire is probably the best way to establish connections between pads. However, mass production involves a pick-and-place machine, which doesn’t have the capability of unrolling and cutting jumper wires. In such cases, a separate machine is needed for jumper wires – but this adds setup and processing costs and requires more equipment and space. Therefore, zero ohm resistors which can be handled by a pick and place machine like any other SMT component are the perfect alternative that saves cost and time in assembly.<br>How do you test a zero-ohm resistor?<br>For a resistor component such as an SMD resistor, the zero ohm resistor is basically specified as DC resistance, not AC impedance. The accuracy of the zero ohm resistor at DC should be tested by using a precise digital multi-meter (DMM) such as the Keysight 34420A.<br>To evaluate AC impedance characteristic of the zero ohm resistor, the E4980A or the E4990A should be used with a Kelvin contact test fixture such as the 16047A (for the leaded resistor) or the 16044A (for the SMD resistor.) Since the AC impedance at low frequencies is very small and difficult to measure, the AC impedance should be measured at a high frequency above 1 MHz.",
