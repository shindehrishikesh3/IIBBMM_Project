      "CONTENT": "Quiescent Power Consumption<br>The quiescent current of a component or circuit is the current that it uses internally rather than supplying on to the load; it is the difference between input and output current, and should be kept as low as possible to maximise efficiency and promote a green footprint, as increased quiescent current means increased quiescent power consumption.<br>In semiconductor circuits, quiescent current consists of bias current such as band-gap reference, sampling resistor, and error amplifier currents, and the gate drive current of the series pass element, which do not contribute to output power. The value of quiescent current is mostly determined by the series pass element, topologies, ambient temperature, etc.<br>For bipolar transistors, the quiescent current increases proportionally with the output current, because the series pass element is a current-driven device. In addition, in the dropout region the quiescent current can increase due to the additional parasitic current path between the emitter and the base of the bipolar transistor, which is caused by a lower base voltage than that of the output voltage.<br>For MOS transistors, the quiescent current has a near constant value with respect to the load current since the device is a voltage-driven device. The only things that contribute to the quiescent current for MOS transistors are the biasing currents of band–gap, sampling resistor, and error amplifier.",

This function is implemented by a system of moving and fixed units. Such connectors meet or exceed the MIL-DTL-38999 Series 1 requirements, and are used for military and aeronautical applications, as well as demanding industrial environments.<br>These are durable components, with 500 cycle rating and moisture and corrosion resistance. Their temperature range is -65°C to +175°C. Versions are available to withstand 500 hours of salt spray exposure.<br>Specialised ARINC 600-compatible connectors are also available. These connectors provide low insertion force contacts, front removable keying posts, field replaceable inserts for size 22 and power contacts, and up to 800 size 22 contact positions in one connector. Crimp, coaxial, power, printed circuit and wire wrap connectors are available, as well as waveguide connections.<br>Rack and panel connectors from other suppliers are also available for a wide range of industry sectors. Well-designed products can be useful where space is at a premium in power, control and communications circuits within aircraft, portable equipment and instrumentation.

      "CONTENT": "Sampling Rate<br>The sampling rate refers to the process of converting a continuous signal into discrete units of time. Whether recording sounds, capturing images or processing an electromagnetic wave, many sources of information are continuous or analogue in nature. Before digital devices can make sense of the such information, the data must be converted. This involves taking snapshots of the signal so that it can be manipulated and reassembled into a readable format. The speed at which these snapshots are taken - usually measured in seconds - is known as the sampling rate.<br>The conversion is performed by an analogue to digital converter. The converter turns physical information such as sound, light and temperature into a pattern of numbers that the computer can understand.<br>Sample rates are measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher sampling rates produce better quality media. In video, the sampling rate determines how often the light intensity of each video line is sampled. The sampling rate also determines the frame rate. A frame rate of 24 frames per second is required to prevent flickering.<br>In audio, most content has a sampling rate of 44.1 kilohertz, which is equivalent to the maximum bandwidth audible to most humans. However, a lower rate may be selected to reduce file size, conserve CPU usage or where the sound quality is unimportant.",
