It is as simple to use as a Zener diode. Series voltage references are ideal for circuits with large changes in supply voltage or load current. They are especially useful with very large load currents as there is no series resistor between the reference and supply.<br><br>Our specialist products include precision voltage references for signal-conditioning applications using a single voltage source. A particularly popular offering is the TLV431 precision voltage reference. The TLV431 is a three terminal adjustable shunt reference offering excellent temperature stability and output current handling capability up to 20mA. The output voltage may be set to any chosen voltage between 1.24V and 18V by selection of two external divider resistors. It can be used as a replacement for Zener diodes in many applications requiring an improvement in Zener performance.<br><br>Fixed, adjustable and programmable variants are available in both shunt and series configurations.

They divide into Linear Voltage Regulators and Switching Voltage Regulators.<br><br>Linear voltage regulators use linear, non-switching techniques to regulate the voltage output from the power supply. The regulator’s resistance varies according to the load and results in a constant output voltage.<br><br>All linear regulators require an input voltage at least some minimum amount higher than the desired output voltage. That minimum amount is called the dropout voltage. A low-dropout or LDO regulator is a DC linear regulator which can regulate the output voltage even when the supply voltage is very close to the output voltage.<br><br>The LM317 is a popular adjustable three-terminal linear voltage regulator capable of supplying more than 1.5A over an output-voltage range of 1.25V to 37V. It requires only two external resistors to set the output voltage. The LM317 features a typical line regulation of 0.01% and typical load regulation of 0.1%. It includes current limiting, thermal overload protection, and safe operating area protection. Overload protection remains functional even if the ADJUST terminal is disconnected.<br><br>Our Linear Voltage Regulator range includes LDO types.<br><br>Today’s power management solutions demand lower power consumption under various load conditions, less space, high reliability and wide input voltage. These requirements are driving the need for highly efficient, wide VIN, low quiescent current (IQ) switching regulators in a broad range of applications.<br><br>Switching regulators rapidly switch a series element on and off. They can operate with both synchronous and non-synchronous switches (FETs). These devices store the input energy temporarily and then release that energy to the output at a different voltage level. The switch’s duty cycle sets the amount of charge transferred to the load.<br><br>Switching regulators are efficient because the series element is either fully conducting or switched off, so it dissipates almost no power. Switching regulators can generate output voltages that are higher than the input voltage or of opposite polarity, unlike linear regulators.<br><br>We offer Adjustable, Fixed, and Multi-Output Switching Regulators.",
